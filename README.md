### What I learned

How to use user inputs for search query
I tried using string concatenation for the search param but that didn't work so I went down a unproductive rabbit hole until I finally realized you just need to use backticks/ string interpolation... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Once I realized that I quickly figured out that I also needed to scope the userQuery variable to the function so that it updates with the event listener and not beforehand.

### Continued development

I didn't hide my API key because I ran out of time... üòÖ but in the future I'd hide the key using either Netlify functions or dotenv files and NodeJS. I'm not worried about this at the moment because it's a free API (with limited requests).
